# Learning-Tensorflow
### This Repository contains two files:  
1. Basic_Codes: This file contains codes of basics of Tensorflow.
2. MLP_MNIST_Tensorflow: Here, we have implemented a simple 3 to 5 layered MLP architecture using MNIST handwritten digit dataset. 
We have applied all of the techniques likes dropouts, batch normalization, sigmoid, ReLu, gradientDescentOptimizer and Adam optimizer using only Tensorflow.
### How to Run
Just run any of the ipynb files from any of the two folders.
